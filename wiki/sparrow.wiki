#summary A brief introduction to Sparrow templates.

= Introduction =

Sparrow is a template language heavily inspired by Cheetah. It started out as an experiment to see if techniques from the compiler world were applicable to the mundane details of templates.

At this point, Sparrow works - at least in theory. There are basic tests cases that assure templates are parse, compile, generate and execute correctly. Most language features are covered with a high-level test.

= Details =

The syntax itself is extremely similar to Cheetah, however there are some directives and language features that have been omitted (usually on purpose).  The change log and parser.g file are currently the primary source of information on this, which is not the best. More documentation to come.

Trivial Cheetah templates will probably compile in Sparrow, so that's probably a good place to start.
